    Take a look at the principles below to give your document effective format and design. Format has to do with the way your information is organized, while design deals with the many elements that will give your resume visual appeal. Format and design choices should be intentional and speak to your hiring audience. We like to use the word principles rather than rules because resume writing is a subjective process and many opinions exist. Our  advice is to always consider your hiring audience first and then utilize resume guides for tips and examples of how the professional resume is created.

  <ul>
    <li><b>Resume length: </b>Consider limiting your resume to one page if you can describe your relevant and persuasive content within that frame. If you have a lot of content or you're a seasoned professional with years of experience, you may need more than one page. What you don't want is a partial page as this communicates an inability to be concise or that you lack content.
    </li>
    <li><b>Eye catching name and contact information: </b>You want your name and contact information to get your readersâ„¢ attention and be easy to read. However, try to  avoid using large graphics, photos, and gaudy font color.</li>
    <li><b>Start your resume with a branding section: </b>A branding section should come after your name and contact section. The focus should be on how you meet your hiring audience's needs in dynamic and concise language. The top third of your first page is critical in  getting your reader's attention and encouraging them to read the rest of your resume. There are many ways to  construct a branding section but a proven method is to include a narrative summary of your career/preparation and a list of core competencies/knowledge/skills.</li>
    <li><b>Follow your branding section with an education section: </b>For an upcoming graduate or recent graduate, it's best to follow your branding with education rather than experience. Even if you have significant experience, listing the education section first gives context to your present status.</li>
    <li><b>For experience use a reverse chronological format: </b>For the vast majority of resumes, an experience section listed in reverse chronological format will work best. You  may choose to have two experience sections, one with related experience that highlights your relevant skills and  accomplishments. The second experience section will show additional employment history that may not be as relevant. Other sections you might include in your format: research, internships, volunteer work, leadership, laboratory skills, publications, professional memberships, presentations step.
